Goals

  Revision: $Id$

  Make it very easy to create a kind of Explorer for:

    - Documents
      - using portal_tree for folders and documents

    - All Vocabularies
      - Hierarchy vocabulary

    - Directories
      - acl_users
      - ldap

  What is an explorer ?

    Assuming that a node is a container and a leaf is not.

    An Explorer contains 2 part:

      - the left part display hierarchy of node using a tree, the
        path to the selected node is expanded (display all children of
        parents of the selected node)

      - the right part display a listing of the content of the selected node
        it may display either nodes and leaves, only nodes or only leaves.
        this part should handle filtering, sorting and batching

  This should be easy to do:

    We don't want any processing from zpt or python scripts

    Writing a new explorer should be simple
